This is my first landing page for The Odin Project
Using flexbox to put thigns in place, it was really funny I learnd a lot and this is the first of many!

In the css folder you'll find all the files of the different parts of the page, they come in the next order:
1 header
2 information
3 quote
4 call-to
5 style
